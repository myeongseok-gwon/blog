## Why MyST?

I once enjoyed reading a [book on causal inference](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html). The content was great, but I was also fascinated by how one could write a quality book simply by uploading `ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) files to GitHub. It also supported essential features like code copying and search functionality.

The name of that project is `Jupyter Book`. However, after looking at the [developer blog](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/blog/2024-05-20-jupyter-book-myst/), I discovered that the Jupyter Book 2 project is currently in full development.
> **Note** Jupyter Book 2 is not yet a completed project. Since it's still in development, there are several repositories related to it, and `mystmd` that I use is one of them. View repositories: <https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-book/repositories>

I tested various MyST-based projects individually. I found that the guide documentation was the most decent, and I chose `mystmd` which looked the most appealing to my eyes. While `Jupyter Book` could be a safe choice with many published books already, I had expectations for various new features, and above all, they mentioned that version 1 (Jupyter Book) would focus on maintenance as they moved toward version 2 (MyST-based).

This is an example of a paper PDF export. You can easily export text written in markdown to PDF by selecting a template. Source: [mystmd.org](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-static-exports)

## MyST for Who?

1. A basic understanding of markdown is required. Reference: [Markdown Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/)

2. If you don't use Jupyter notebook, you might wonder if it's necessary. You can do everything sufficiently using Notion.
